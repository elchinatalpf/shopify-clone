# Shopify Clone - Epic Breakdown Guide

## üìñ **What is an Epic?**

An **Epic** is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller **User Stories**. Each user story represents a single feature or functionality from the user's perspective.

**Project Structure:**
```
Epic (2-4 weeks)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story #1 (2-8 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story #2 (2-8 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story #3 (2-8 hours)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User Story #4 (2-8 hours)
```

## **User Story Format**

```

```

**Components:**
- **Role**: Who is this for? (Admin, Customer)
- **Action**: What do they want to do?

## **Breaking Down Epics - Guidelines**

### Good User Story Characteristics (INVEST)

**I - Independent**: Can be completed without dependencies
**N - Negotiable**: Details can be discussed
**V - Valuable**: Delivers value to the user
**E - Estimable**: Can estimate time needed
**S - Small**: 2-8 hours of work
**T - Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria

### Example: Too Large ‚ùå
```
As an Admin, I want a complete product management system
```
**Problem**: Too vague, weeks of work, not testable

### Example: Good Size ‚úÖ
```
As an Admin, I want to create a new product with name and price,
so that I can start building my store's catalog.
```
**Why**: Specific action, 2-4 hours, clear acceptance criteria

---

## **Epic Planning Process**

### 1. Define Epic Scope
```markdown
**Epic**: Authentication & Store Management
**Duration**: 10-15 hours (Week 1-2)
**Outcome**: Admins can sign up, create stores, and log out
```

### 2. List User Stories
Brainstorm all features needed:
- Admin sign up
- View dashboard
- Create store
- Switch stores
- Log out

### 3. Write Acceptance Criteria
For each story, define "done":
- What must work?
- What must be validated?
- What edge cases must be handled?

### 4. Create GitHub Issues
Convert each user story to an issue with:
- Clear title
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical tasks
- Definition of done

### 5. Prioritize
Order issues by dependency:
```
1. Issue #1 (Auth) ‚Üê Must do first
2. Issue #2 (Dashboard) ‚Üê Depends on #1
3. Issue #3 (Create Store) ‚Üê Depends on #2
4. Issue #4 (Switch Stores) ‚Üê Depends on #3
5. Issue #5 (Logout) ‚Üê Can do anytime
```

```

### Be Specific

‚ùå "Admin can manage products"
‚úÖ "As an Admin, I want to edit a product's price so I can run sales"
```

### Include Edge Cases
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Form validates price is positive number
- [ ] Form prevents duplicate product names
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Success toast appears after save

```

### Make it Testable
```markdown

3. Fill in price: "-10" (negative number)
4. Click "Create Product"
5. **Expected**: Error message "Price must be positive"
```
