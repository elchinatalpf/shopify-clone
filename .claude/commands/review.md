# Shopify Clone - Self-Review Checklist

## üîç **Pre-Merge Quality Gate**

Self-review is your **quality gate** before merging. Review your own code as critically as you would review someone else's.

---

## **Self-Review Process**

### 1. Navigate to PR
- Go to your Pull Request on GitHub
- Click the **"Files changed"** tab
- Review every single line

### 2. Review Systematically
Go through each file and ask yourself these questions:

## **Commenting on Your Own PR**

Leave comments on your own code where:
- You considered alternative approaches
- The code is complex and needs explanation
- You're unsure about a decision
- You want to highlight something clever
- You plan to refactor in a future PR

### Example Comments

```markdown
üí° **Design Decision**: I chose to use localStorage for the cart
instead of database storage because customers don't need accounts
for MVP. This will need to change when we add user accounts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue**: This doesn't handle concurrent store creation
by the same user. Added TODO to add rate limiting in future PR.

ü§î **Question**: Is this the right place to sync Auth0 user to
database, or should this be in middleware?

‚ú® **Optimization**: Using Prisma's include here reduces database
roundtrips from 3 to 1.
```

## **Common Issues to Watch For**

### TypeScript
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - using 'any'
const handleSubmit = (data: any) => { ... }

// ‚úÖ Good - specific type
const handleSubmit = (data: CreateStoreInput) => { ... }
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - unhandled promise rejection
const stores = await fetch('/api/stores')

// ‚úÖ Good - proper error handling
try {
  const res = await fetch('/api/stores')
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch')
  const stores = await res.json()
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error)
  toast.error('Failed to load stores')
}
```

### Server vs Client Components
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - using useState in Server Component
export default function Page() {
  const [state, setState] = useState() // ERROR!
}

// ‚úÖ Good - extract to Client Component
'use client'
export function InteractiveComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState() // OK!
}
```

### Security
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - no session check in API route
export async function DELETE(request: Request) {
  await prisma.store.delete({ where: { id } })
}

// ‚úÖ Good - verify authentication
export async function DELETE(request: Request) {
  const session = await getSession()
  if (!session) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })

  // Verify user owns this store
  const store = await prisma.store.findUnique({
    where: { id, userId: session.user.dbId }
  })
  if (!store) return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 })

  await prisma.store.delete({ where: { id } })
}
```

### Validation
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - no validation
const { name, price } = await request.json()
await prisma.product.create({ data: { name, price } })

// ‚úÖ Good - Zod validation
const body = await request.json()
const validated = createProductSchema.parse(body)
await prisma.product.create({ data: validated })
```

## **Before Clicking "Merge"**

### Final Verification
```bash
# 1. Pull latest main
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Merge main into your branch
git checkout your-branch
git merge main

# 3. Verify no conflicts

# 4. Run checks
npm run typecheck
npm run lint

# 5. Test in browser one more time

# 6. Push if changes were made
git push origin your-branch
```

### Merge Checklist

---

## **After Merge**

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify merge** - Check GitHub that PR is closed
2. **Verify issue closed** - Issue should auto-close
3. **Pull latest main** - `git checkout main && git pull`
4. **Delete branch** - GitHub usually does this automatically
5. **Update project board** - Move issue to "Done"

### Update Documentation
- [ ] Update Phase status if phase is complete
- [ ] Mark todos as done in planning docs
- [ ] Add screenshots to README if UI feature
- [ ] Create ADR if architectural decision made

## **Self-Review Red Flags**

If you see these, pause and reconsider:

üö© **"I'll fix this later"** ‚Üí Fix it now or create an issue
üö© **Commented-out code** ‚Üí Delete it (it's in git history)
üö© **TODO comments** ‚Üí Either fix now or create GitHub issue
üö© **console.log for debugging** ‚Üí Remove before merge
üö© **Hardcoded values** ‚Üí Move to constants or config
üö© **Giant functions (>50 lines)** ‚Üí Break into smaller functions
üö© **Copy-pasted code** ‚Üí Extract to reusable utility
üö© **No error handling** ‚Üí Add try-catch and user feedback

---

## **Remember**

> "Code is read more than it is written. Make it readable."

Your self-review is demonstrating to future employers that you:
- ‚úÖ Care about code quality
- ‚úÖ Think critically about your own work
- ‚úÖ Understand trade-offs and edge cases
- ‚úÖ Follow professional standards
- ‚úÖ Take ownership of your work

**This PR is part of your portfolio. Make it excellent.**
